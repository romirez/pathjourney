# Path's Journey

This is a project to log GPS coordinates of a sailing vessel (using AIS & KVH coordinates), and display a track using Google Maps. The app allows you to attach photos and logs to any point on the map, and there's basic access control to allow guests to view the journey log without edit access.

The webapp is based on Vue.JS, and the backend is run on Firebase (Authentication, Database, Storage, Hosting & Functions)
